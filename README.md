# Contacs Rating

With given data of list of contacts that contains name, company size and title, this program will produce a new data file "ratedContacts.json" which will contain their ratings. Ratings are evaluated by three main factors 
- Seniority level
- Company size
- Job Role


- Developed a multi-layer relational data system on MERN Stack to handle state changes of the postings
- Utilized JSON Web Tokens to store encrypted user information from the client-side to the cloud
- Organized time dependent job controls to handle data flow of user experience in status changes
